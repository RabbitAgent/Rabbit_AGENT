# RabbitAGENT: Privacy-Preserving AI Verification Network

**End-to-End Encrypted AI Inference with Hybrid Cryptographic Attestation**

## Project Overview
RabbitAGENT is a decentralized framework combining Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enable privacy-preserving AI services. Our architecture provides cryptographic guarantees for both model integrity and data confidentiality across healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Verification**  
  TEE-based real-time validation (18ms) + ZKP post-hoc auditing (Groth16, 480ms/proof)
- **Enterprise Runtime**  
  INT8 quantization with ≤0.9% FP32 accuracy loss (ONNX benchmark)
- **Cross-Platform Trust**  
  Certified execution across Intel SGX/ARM TrustZone/AMD SEV
- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  Automated GDPR Article 35 & HIPAA §164.312 controls
